# AI Summer Internship 2024 - Project Showcase

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the AI Summer Internship 2024! This project showcases the work I did during my internship, including hands-on experience with image processing, machine learning, and computer vision techniques.

## ðŸš€ Introduction

Hello everyone! Iâ€™m Harsh Maheshwari, a student of the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to intern as an AI Intern at Zigguratss Artwork LLP in Delhi. Over the course of my internship from May 1st, 2024, to June 15th, 2024, I worked on a range of projects, gained hands-on experience in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, and developed new skills that Iâ€™m excited to share with you all.

In this repository, Iâ€™ll walk you through my week-by-week journey during the internship, detailing what I learned, the projects I worked on, and the challenges I faced.

## ðŸ“… Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 1: Generate Description and Title of a Given Painting Photo

**Learning and Exploration:**
- Familiarized with image processing libraries such as OpenCV and PIL.
- Studied machine learning models for image captioning, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
- Explored pre-trained models like InceptionV3 for feature extraction and LSTM for sequence generation.

**Implementation:**
- Set up the development environment and installed necessary libraries.
- Loaded and preprocessed painting images.
- Extracted features using a pre-trained CNN model.

### Week 2: Generate Description and Title of a Given Painting Photo

**Learning and Exploration:**
- Delved deeper into Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text generation.
- Studied the architecture of encoder-decoder models for image captioning.

**Implementation:**
- Integrated the feature extractor with an LSTM model for caption generation.
- Trained the model on a dataset of painting images and corresponding descriptions.
- Fine-tuned the model parameters to improve accuracy and coherence of generated descriptions.

### Week 3: Show User How a Painting Will Look on Different Walls

**Learning and Exploration:**
- Explored techniques for image blending and homography to align the painting with the wall.
- Studied methods for perspective transformation and color correction to make the painting look realistic on different walls.

**Implementation:**
- Developed a function to detect and extract wall regions from user-uploaded photos.
- Implemented the perspective transformation to fit the painting onto the wall.
- Added options for users to adjust the size and position of the painting on the wall.
